## Moving on

At this point, we will shift gears and allow you to work for yourself. There is plenty of functionality left to implement. 

1. Add a function to calculate BMI using the imperial method.
2. Modify the UI to allow the user to choose between the Metric- and Imperial methods
3. Add some CSS to the web interface to create a better look and feel of the application - why not use some of the great frameworks available out there, like [ZURB Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) or [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)?
4. Create a local repository and push up your code to GitHub
5. Deploy your own version of the calculator with Github Pages.


If you want to find some inspiration you can have a look at a slightly styled version of the BMI Calculator that we have deployed using gh-pages to github.io.

You can make any Github repository into a web page. On your repository, click Settings, then scroll down to Github Pages and select a branch (the one with the latest changes is best, probably `master`). Click "save", then Github will show you the link to your new website. That's it!
