## Proper documentation.

What and how should you document?
The following section is all about documenting your work. During this course, this is very important because it gives a potential employee insight into how you work and think. 
The following documentation should be added in your README file on your repo. Make sure that you use [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to properly format your document. 

- **The code** - What your code does
- **Dependencies** - What gems, frameworks or tools your code runs on
- **Setup** - How to run the code on your computer
- **Instructions** - The different steps to run the program
- **Acknowledgements** - If you have used other peoples code you should link it here
- **Updates/Improvements plans** - What updates or improvements you plan to do
 - **License** - What license you use and what the terms are for others to use your code.


### The code
This section is about what problem you are trying to solve with the code. And how it is solving it. This section provides a type of synopsis or a summary. If you have a deployed application you can add the URL in this section. 

### Dependencies
If your code is built on third party software or specific frameworks. You can also include tools that are necessary for the code to function.

### Setup
How would anyone that reads your code go about to run it on their computer? Please provide detailed instructions and the setup that their computer needs to have to run the code.

### Instructions
Once the code base is the setup you need to provide instructions on how to use the software.

**Tips**:
To document the codebase you need to make sure that your code does what it is supposed to do. We have confirmation that it is functional by unit testing our code with Rspec. But we still need to manually test our code. 

Open up `irb` load the files and create the different instances of all the classes. Run your code in the terminal. 
Note down all the different steps you took to get your code to perform its magic.

### Acknowledgements
In this section, you add the different links to materials that you needed to create your software. This might include guides, Github issues, forum responses, etc. 

### Updates/Improvements plans
Generally speaking, the code is never finished. There is always room for improvement. 
In this section, you add what new features or bug fixes you will add in the future. 

### License
The last step is to add the license that your software is released through. This restricts the use of the software. All of our projects will be under the [MIT-license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) during this course. 

Add the documentation to your README, commit and push it up
