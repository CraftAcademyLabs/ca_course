## Your assignment

You are assigned by your Project Manager to work on an application that is undocumented and not actively maintained.

You and your team's task is to test the code base, deploy it to a staging server and get it to a state where adding new functionality is possible.

This also means that you will need to find any bugs and broken functionality and fix those. 

A big part of your work will be to cover the application with tests. 

- Write Acceptance tests & Unit the entire workflow & the models using RSpec
- Work in a group and manage multiple tasks at the same time
