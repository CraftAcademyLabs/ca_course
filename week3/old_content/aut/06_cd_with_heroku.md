## Setting up Continous Deployment with Heroku

* You need to have created a Heroku application, we will go over this in a demo this week. If we have not delivered that demo yet, skip this part for now.

* Go to your Heroku dashboard and click on ur project.

* Go to the deploy settings tab and activate Github as the applications deployment method

* Underneath that option you should now be able to connect the Heroku application to a specific repo(your `rails_demo` application).

* Now you need to decide which branch you want to be deployed, pick the master branch

* Now click the button that says "Enable Automatic Deploys"
