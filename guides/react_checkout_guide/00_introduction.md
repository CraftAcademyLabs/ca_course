# Adding Checkout functionality to your React application

```
This guide is based on a demo that we ran a while back. Please take note that there might be issues for you when adding this functionality as your implementation probably looks different. This is also the first iteration of the guide and updates will be made in the future.
If there are typos or issues in this guide, please notify a coach
```

In this section we are going to add checkout functionality to our react application.
The prerequisite for this functionality is that we have products on our page that are ready to sell. Please remember as we implement we will omit explaining code that has already been covered. Remember to commit often in case you need to revert back and not lose large sections of the implementation.

Start with making sure that you have the latest code pulled from GitHub on your development branch and create a new branch called `add_order_functionality` or something that you think is appropriate to the user story.

As always we will work in a test-driven way. Making sure that we let our acceptance test guide our development. This will ensure us that we are not biting off more than we can chew. But also that we stay in scope.

If you want to only learn about how to create a checkout functionality in react you can clone down the following repos:
