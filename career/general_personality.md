## Characteristics of a Programmer

Here's some sample questions that you might encounter when an potential employer want to assess your characteristics that can signal if you make a good addition to their programming team.

**If the interviewer does not ask questions about these topics, you as a candidate should try to bring them up yourself.**

### Describe your experience with different programming languages

Technical skills

One mistake many hiring managers make is hiring from a checklist of requirements. Instead of requiring three years of C++ and one year of Java, look at the big picture. A programmer who has worked mostly in an older language but has recently added a new language to his certifications may be the perfect fit, since his years of experience give him a great foundation in other areas of programming.

### What do you do to keep your programming skills current?

Willingness to learn

Technology is always evolving and the skills and abilities a programmer has today will likely be outdated in a few years. It’s important to find a programmer who has an interest in following the latest trends and is eager to participate in any continuing education opportunities that are available.

### How do you handle bugs in your code?

Debugging

Creating code is only part of a programmer’s job. When software doesn’t work as expected, a programmer is expected to get to the root of the problem quickly and effectively. Instead of spending hours blindly making changes, search for a programmer who prefers to carefully investigate his code and research possible issues until an answer is found.

### Describe your ideal work environment

Work environment match

Some programmers require complete silence to concentrate, while others thrive in chaos. A worker’s personal preferences are an important part of his productivity, so it’s best to be clear about your office environment up front to avoid problems after the person is hired.

### What are your passion projects/hobbies?

Passion for the work

This is a tricky one. Many employers think that true programmers must be “computer geeks”, spending their time gaming, building servers or creating apps for friends. While this passion isn't a necessity, it's often a way to find top-shelf candidates. People that attend our bootcamp are not code obsessives with no other dimension to their personality. They do not devote every single moment of their life to coding and the don't live the stereotyped developer lifestyle. But we still argue that they are passionate - in a way that makes them, in a long run, more valuable to an organisation than people who code every second of every day.

Bootcamp graduates are self-motivated, embrace challenge and are intelligent problem solvers with a broad set of skills and experience. They have the self-confidence to make an informed choice about pivoting into a new profession and planning for the long term. They are also tough - tough enough to make it through a bootcamp, an endeavor that not only requires them to learn a completely new skill-set but quite often reassesses their whole approach towards how they function as professionals.

Being able to do all that takes a lot of courage, determination, motivation and .., yes, passion.

### Describe a time when you were under extreme pressure and your application wasn’t working. What did you do?

Grace under fire

It may not seem like it to the outsider, but programming can be an extremely stressful profession. When deadlines are tight and nothing seems to be working, it's easy to freeze up. We argue that the ideal candidate should be able to handle even the most stressful situations calmly and, most importantly, be able to continue working. The challenge is to be able to showcase situations like that from your previous career or the camp itself and tell a compelling story about how you dealt with overcoming the obstacles.

### Explain how your favorite application works in a way a layman would understand.

People skills
 Programmers generally aren’t expected to have heavy-duty customer service talents. It seems to be understood at the outset that they’ll mostly be sitting in front of a computer all day. Yet programmers are regularly expected to interact with managers, co-workers, and clients, so the ability to work well with others is a must. This is especially true if your programmers are occasionally asked to participate in client meetings and explain how a system works.

### Tell us about a time when you saved time by automating a process.

Laziness (?!?)

Larry Wall, the original author of, The Perl Programming Languages, describes three good qualities in a good programmer: laziness, impatience and hubris. Laziness may sound like a bad trait for any employee to have, but IT managers have said that if you want to find the best way to do something, ask a lazy person. Chances are, that person will have found the quickest, most efficient way to do it. A company’s programming staff can often find a way to automate processes, saving time and money.

### Have you ever made a suggestion that improved a business’s processes?

Business perspective

It’s easy to lose sight of the big picture while focusing on creating one piece of software. The ideal programmer has a business focus that allows him to move beyond the current application. A business-focused programmer will suggest ideas for new applications that can improve operations.

### Explain your approach to a new design. What do you do first?

Ability to plan

Rather than jumping into a new assignment, a good addition to your programming staff will first learn as much as possible about the desired end product. Once he’s completed that analysis, the programmer will first design the program structure before typing the first line of code.


### Have you ever spent hours on a code, only to find it was the wrong approach? What did you do?

Ability to handle failure

Programmers rarely get everything right on the first try. In fact, failure is almost a certainty. It’s important to find programming staff that see errors and bugs as a challenge rather than a sign of defeat. Persistence is important, as well as the ability to start over if necessary, even after hours of work.

### Can you tell us about  a rewarding team experience?

Teamwork mentality

A programmer rarely works alone, even if he’s the only developer in a company. The ability to work with business users, marketing and sales staff, and fellow programmers is essential.

### Tell us about a time you had to learn about a particular business? How did you do your research?

Willingness to learn

A programmer’s language is only part of the picture. A good developer must learn about specific industries in order to design programs that work for its employees or customers.

### Describe a time when you had to meet a tight deadline

Respect for deadlines

Most programmers work on projects with deadlines. While it’s important that managers understand a reasonable turnaround time for coding a new application or repairing an existing one, programmers should also show respect for deadlines. It’s important to determine that an applicant will do everything possible to meet assigned deadlines.
