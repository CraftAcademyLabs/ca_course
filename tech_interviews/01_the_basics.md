You have 40 minutes to complete the assessment. You can look wherever you want for help with your answers (Google, StackOverflow, course materials, etc.), as long as you do not ask me (the coach) for help. 

As you work on this exercise, please 'think aloud.' That means verbally describing your mental process as it develops, including the doubts and questions you have, the solution strategies you consider, and the reasons that justify your decisions.

### [](https://github.com/CraftAcademyLabs/coach-guides/blob/master/miscellaneous/assessments/assessment_1.md#think-aloud-protocol)Think Aloud Protocol

The 'Think-aloud' protocol involve the participant thinking aloud as he or she are performing a set of specified tasks or working on an excercise. The participant are asked to say whatever comes into his/her mind as he complete the task. This might include what he/she is looking at, thinking, doing, and feeling. This gives the coach valuable insight into the participant's cognitive processes (rather than only their final product), to make thought processes as explicit as possible during task performance. Sessions should be recorded so that coaches can go back and refer to what participants did and how they reacted.

## Setup

Let's get started..

- Create a folder called `tech_interviews` and initialize `git` inside this folder. 

- Create a repo on your github account that is called `tech_interviews` and att the repo as your remote in your `tech_interviews` folder.

- Create a new branch called `week_1_tech_interview`

- Create a folder named `week_1_assessment` and add a text file called `answers.md` where you can write down your answers.

- Commit and push up your code and share your repo with your coach.


## Question 1 - Variables

Create a variable and set it equal to 'variable'.
What kind of datatype is this?

Write some few examples datatypes in your answers file. 


## Question 2 

Hashes and Arrays

Open irb. We're going to make some cars. 
- Create two hashes, one for each car, with the following attributes: `wheels`, `max_speed`, `color`

- Create an array that contains both cars.

- How do we use the array to access the second car? How do we find the second car's color?

- Add the code to your answers file, commit and push


## Question 3

**Classes and Methods**

- Create a new folder called `cars` and inside of that folder, create a file called `car.rb` 

Inside that file create a class `Car` and add a method to "paint" a car a new color. 

- Open irb. Load your 'car.rb' file. 

- Create an instance of a Car and change its color.

- Once you have changed the cars color, commit and push your code. 


## Question 4 

RSpec
- Create a unit test for our Car class to test our "painting" method.
- A car should have a driver. Create an instance_double Driver. Write a second test for this and make it pass.

Please answer the following questions in your `answers` file
- How do you initialize rspec in a folder? 
- We would ordinarily have written our tests first, then written code to make them pass. Why?
- What are the benefits of TDD?
- Write a user story for the painting method. 
- Commit and push to your repo
