## Welcome to this course

We at Craft Academy are commited to make sure that all of our students are job ready at the end of the bootcamp. This means that besides coding our students need to know how to handle technical interviews. The tech interviews that companies conduct do vary. 

We have collected different types of tech interviews over the years and are sharing the most common ones. You will conduct these interviews with the oversight of a coach this is so that we can assess you but also give you feedback in order for your to improve your coding skills but most of all your communication skills, as these are very important when being interviewed.

The complexity of the tech interviews will grow as we move along in the bootcamp, so make sure that you are constantly coding but also pairprogramming to practice these important skills. 

We will release a new tech interview every other week and they will be held on fridays.
