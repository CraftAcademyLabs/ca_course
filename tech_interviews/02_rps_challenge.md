# Rock - Paper - Scissors

**Note: This is a simulation of a work interview. Please act accordingly.**

In order to assess your coding skills, we want you to accept an programming challenge as part of the hiring process. Your challenge is to build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. 

![](https://github.com/CraftAcademyLabs/coach-guides/raw/master/miscellaneous/assessments/assets/rock_paper_scissors.png)

The rules are well known to everyone, but in case you don't remember, they are as follows:

```
Rock vs Paper-> Paper wins
Rock vs Scissors-> Rock wins
Paper vs Scissor-> Scissor wins
```

This is a two part challenge that will span over 14 days. There are no right or wrong answers or deliveries. It is totally up to you HOW you want to work, what programming language you want to use, if you want to deliver game logic only or if you want to build a web based interface where a player is challenged by the computer or where two players can play against each other. 


####  What do we expect from you is:


1. During the first interview, describe how you would go about with the project as a whole but also on how you would approach implementing the game logic. Describe your thoughts about the process as you think you would have to employ to make this happen. 

2. Sometime during the period between the two inteviews we would need you to deliver the code to us. How would you do that? 

3. During the second inteview, we would need you to talk us through the problem, what challenges did you encounter, how did you go about writing the implementation, what are the main features you think make your game interesting and how can it be expanded upon in the next iteration. We also want you to demo the code and show us how the game works. 

This is a challenge that will show us your level of ambition and your ability to execute your plans. It's a solo project and you are not supposed to collaborate with any other students other than for benchmarking purposes. Talk, discuss, get inspired but write your own code. 

**Remember that Craft Academy Labs uses an agile approach to software development and that we value Test Driven Development and all the techniques that comes with XP.**
