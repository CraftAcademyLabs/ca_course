# Paywall

A big part of the **NewsRoom Challenge** is about monetization. As developers, we need to understand the underlying business the applications we build support. This challenge is about that. 

In order to prepare for this part, we would like you to spend some time understanding the rationale behind paywalls and take a look at how various publishing houses have tackled the challenges involved in implementing this monetization model. 

A good start is [this article from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/11/the-big-unanswered-questions-about-paywalls/547091/), but please do a bit of research on your own, in order to form an opinion. We will be discussing this part extensively during the Design Sprint. 

## The Interface
As you browse around on the various publishing sites, you'll notice that there are many different ways to implement a paywall solution, as well as how to build a user interface that is inclusive and provides a good user experience (UX)

We've included some screenshots for you to look at, but please do try out some live implementations online to see the entire flow of presenting the user with a subscription offer, giving him a few options and charging him for the subscription.
