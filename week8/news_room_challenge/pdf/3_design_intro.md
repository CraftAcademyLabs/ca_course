# Design Sprint

As a first step your team needs to gather for a working session called the Design Sprint. In real projects this is done over several days (2 - 5 days approximately). In this simulation we will set aside one day to this task.

Normally, this sprint includes a lot of input from the Client (Product Owner) and relies on his participation. We will rely in the information provided in the previous chapter and any questions we have will have to be answered by the team or, in the uncertainty is to high, just ignored.

The main objective of this workshop/session is create a Backlog of feature requests that are described in a structured way, discuss each feature, **define the definition of done**, and **assess the complexity** of the implementation.
