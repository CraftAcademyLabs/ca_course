## Epics

The first step is to create a series of **user stories** for the main functions outlined in the system requirements. Initially these will be on a relatively high level and be easily mapped to the overall business objectives of the system - we will refer to them as **Epics**. 

An **epic** captures a large body of work. It is essentially a large user story that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. It may take several sprints to complete an epic. 

An epic can span more than one project, if multiple projects are included in the board to which the epic belongs.
